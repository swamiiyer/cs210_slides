## Lecture Slides for the Intermediate Computing with Data Structures (CS210) Course at UMB

In this repository you will find the LaTeX Beamer based slides I have prepared for the Intermediate Computing with Data Structures (CS210) course I teach at UMB (University of Massachusetts Boston). The primary references for the slides are the books [http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/ Algorithms] by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne and [Introduction to Programming in Java: An Interdisciplinary Approach](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Java-Interdisciplinary-Approach/dp/0321498054/) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

To compile each TeX file to a PDF, run the following command:

```bash
> pdflatex <TeX filename>
```

The script `nupslides` converts a PDF to a form suitable for online viewing (one slide per page) or printing (four slides per page). To convert a PDF, run the following command:

```bash
> nupslides <PDF filename>
```
